# LangkahLokal

**Walk the Culture, One Step at a Time**

## 📍 About The Project

**LangkahLokal** is a map-first web platform designed to help people discover Indonesia's rich cultural heritage like never before. From iconic landmarks and historical sites to authentic local activities and timeless folklore, our mission is to reconnect Indonesians and global travelers with the diverse cultures of the archipelago.

This project was developed for the **Garuda Hacks** hackathon, answering the challenge to **"Connecting Cultures."** We observed that many people, including Indonesians themselves, feel disconnected from their own culture. LangkahLokal aims to bridge this gap by providing a seamless, integrated platform to explore, understand, and experience the soul of Indonesia.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Indonesia's cultural identity is its greatest asset, with 60% of its global appeal rooted in its diverse culture. However, there are significant barriers to accessing and experiencing this heritage:

  * **Scattered Knowledge:** Cultural information is fragmented across inaccessible academic papers, generic blogs, and local stories, leading to a shallow understanding and potential cultural misunderstandings. 
  * **The Authenticity Gap:** Nearly 6 out of 10 travelers (58.97%) seek genuine cultural immersion but are often directed to tourist-centric spots that lack deep, authentic meaning. 
  * **Information Overload:** Travelers spend hours piecing together information from unreliable sources, with many feeling "blind" when visiting a new region in their own country. 

This cultural disconnect is the main challenge we are addressing. How can we leverage technology to meaningfully digitize our cultural heritage and foster genuine human connections to uphold the spirit of *Bhinneka Tunggal Ika*?

## 💡 Our Solution

**LangkahLokal** connects people to local stories, cultural experiences, and historical landmarks across Indonesia in a seamless, meaningful, and map-first approach. Our platform serves as a bridge, moving beyond a simple map to offer a transformative journey where users don't just visit a place—they connect with its soul. We aim to reduce travel research time by 80% and increase the discovery of unique local cultural spots by over 300%.

## ✨ Features

Our website is built with several key features to provide an immersive cultural experience:

  * 🗺️ **Interactive Map:** The core of our platform. Users can explore all 34 provinces of Indonesia, discovering nearby landmarks and activities based on their live location. The map is designed to be intuitive and serves as the primary gateway to cultural exploration. 

  * 🏛️ **Landmarks:** Discover historical sites and places of cultural significance. Each landmark page provides detailed descriptions, historical context, and user reviews, allowing for a deeper understanding beyond a simple visit. 

  * 💃 **Activities:** Find and participate in authentic cultural activities. This feature highlights workshops for local coffee, traditional dance studios (*sanggar tari*), Nusantara-themed photography workshops, and more. This encourages users to actively engage with and support the preservation of local culture.

  * 📖 **Folklore:** Dive into the rich tapestry of Indonesian stories. We have integrated local folklore and unique narratives related to provinces and landmarks, enriching the cultural context and inspiring users to visit the places that inspired these tales. 

  * 🔍 **Advanced Search & Filtering:** A semantic search engine helps users find exactly what they're looking for, with options to filter by region, price range, and category (Landmark or Activity).
